            <h4>Tangier</h4>
            <p>
              Located on the Strait of Gibraltar where Africa meets Europe,
              Tangier has long held strategic importance. Ruled through the
              centuries by waves of conquerors including Romans, Vandals,
              Byzantines, Arabs and Portuguese, the city is more than two and a
              half millennia old, making it one of North Africa's most ancient.
              The medina, kasbah, bazaars and souks are among the country's most
              vibrant, and the beaches are excellent. In the last century,
              Tangier became a hot spot for the international jet set.

            <h4>Innsbruck</h4>
            <p>
              Nestled amidst majestic peaks, this breathtaking city offers a
              unique combination of nature, history, and culture. You can stroll
              its streets full of Baroque and Gothic architecture in the Old
              Town, or discover one of the hip districts such as Mariahilf or
              St. Nikolaus where Innsbruckâ€™s uni students like to meet for a
              drink. After, you can take a cable car from the city centre, and
              in just 20 minutes, reach the Seegrube at 2,000 m (6,562 ft). Here
              you can take in spectacular views of the Inn valley and the
              surrounding mountains.

            <h4>Semur en Auxois</h4>
            <p>
              Semur-en-Auxois has a wealth of cobbled streets lined with ancient
              houses, shops and cafes and unusual features to explore and enjoy.
              The architecture is a mixture of half-timbered properties and more
              'recent' houses with characterful faded shutters and wrought iron
              balconies.Passing through the clock-gate at the top of the town
              you find a small open square with several restaurants and shops to
              explore, and the historic centre of Semur-en-Auxois is all easy to
              reach from here..
